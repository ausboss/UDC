Short version. Two key things. Terminal commands and diff based file editing.

This is a server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities.

This is a fork of [wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander) with enhanced configuration options.

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements
- **NEW: Configurable allowed directories** - Specify which directories Claude can access

## Installation
First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Custom Setup (Recommended)
This method is best if you don't have permissions to directly modify the Claude config file or prefer a guided approach:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasondsmith72/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
```

2. Checkout the appropriate branch:
```bash
git checkout configurable-paths  # For the version with configurable allowed paths
```

3. Install dependencies and build:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

4. Run the custom setup:
```bash
node setup-claude-custom.js
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to update your Claude config file manually.

6. Restart Claude if it's running.

### Option 2: Add to claude_desktop_config manually
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Windows, found at %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@jasondsmith72/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running.

## Configuration

### Allowed Directories
By default, Claude can only access:
1. The current working directory (where the server is running from)
2. The user's home directory

You can customize this by editing the `config.json` file in the root of the project:

```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    "format",
    "mount",
    "umount",
    ...
  ],
  "allowedDirectories": [
    "~",                 // User's home directory
    "~/Documents",       // Documents folder
    "~/Projects",        // Projects folder
    ".",                 // Current working directory
    "/path/to/folder"    // Any absolute path
  ]
}
```

**Notes on allowed directories:**
- Use `~` to refer to the user's home directory
- Use `.` to refer to the current working directory
- You can specify absolute paths as well
- For security reasons, each path is validated before access is granted

### Blocked Commands
You can configure which commands are blocked by editing the `blockedCommands` array in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    "format",
    "mount",
    "umount",
    "mkfs",
    "fdisk",
    "dd",
    "sudo",
    "su",
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata
- `list_allowed_directories`: View which directories the server can access

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes <20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes >20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues setting up or using the MCP server:

1. Check that Claude Desktop is properly installed and has been run at least once
2. Verify that the claude_desktop_config.json file exists and is properly formatted
3. Make sure you have the required permissions to modify the config file
4. Restart Claude Desktop after making changes to the config
5. Check that your desired file paths are in the allowed directories configuration
6. If you're getting "access denied" errors, use the `list_allowed_directories` tool to see which directories are accessible
